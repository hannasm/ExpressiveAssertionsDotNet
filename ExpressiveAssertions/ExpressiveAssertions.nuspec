* 0.9.7 - addition of AssertionInverterTool to treat all success as failure and all failure as success
* 0.9.7 - addition of IgnoreDeclaredFailureAssertionTool which will ignore any declared failure assertions
* 0.9.7 - addition of IgnoreInconclsuiveAssertionTool which will ignore any inconclusive assertions
* 0.9.6 - fix bug with mstest handling of assertion messages
